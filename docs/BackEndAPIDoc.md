# **Docs? What Docs? Oh, You Mean My To-Do List!**

Welcome to the **documentation void** of a one-person army. I'm juggling all hats for this project—dev, ops, tester, and snack fetcher. While docs are *important*, they often take a backseat to everything else (like fixing bugs at 2 AM).

That’s why you won’t find much relevant context here… *yet*. 

Check back later; maybe future me will have done a better job. Until then, if you’re blocked or just curious, reach out—I promise I’ll prioritize you over this doc!
